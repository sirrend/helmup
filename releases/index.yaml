      What is Helmup?
      Helmup is an innovative tool designed for Ops Engineers, making Helm chart upgrades effortless and efficient.

      As an Ops Engineer, you often need to upgrade Helm chart versions for various reasons:

       - Security Fixes
       - New Features
       - Staying Up-to-Date
       - And More...

      To streamline this process, we created HELMUP!

      Leveraging AI, Helmup scans your GitHub repositories, identifies all your Helm charts, and searches online for the latest updates. Once a new version is found, the AI engine automatically updates your files and values, and then:

       - Creates a Pull Request (PR) in your GitHub repository
       - Optionally generates a Jira ticket
       - Optionally sends notifications via Slack or Microsoft Teams
      
      Architecture

      Helmup is built on a microservices architecture, consisting of three core components:

       - Engine: Handles the AI and upgrade mechanism
       - Scraper: Scans your GitHub repository for Helm charts
       - Notifications: Manages notifications through MS Teams or Slack
